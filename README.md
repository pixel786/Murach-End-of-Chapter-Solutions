# Murach-End-of-Chapter-Solutions
This repo includes the end of chapter solutions to Murach's Second Edition of MySQL.

## Questions I was unsure of
1. Chapter 6 Question 7
2. Chapter 7 Question 5 (solution doesn't actually run)
3. Chapter 7 Question 8 (come back to this one)
4. Chapter 9 - Chose to complete only the first two questions because formatting data types is straightforward


## Reflections
Chapter 7 shows how to write complex queries and answer more thoughtprovoking questions from tables. I may need to look for other resources to practice correlated queries.
